# Memory Agent Plugin

Universal repo-local agent plugin for Infinity Context. The plugin exposes the
Infinity Context MCP adapter and memory skill to Codex, Claude, Gemini, OpenCode,
and Cursor through `plugin-kit-ai` generated artifacts.

Cursor workspace MCP uses the sibling MCP-only plugin at
`plugins/infinity-context-agent-plugin-cursor-workspace`. Gemini lifecycle hooks use
the sibling hook-enabled extension at `plugins/infinity-context-agent-plugin-gemini-hooks`.
`plugin-kit-ai` 1.2.2 validates Cursor workspace as an MCP-only lane and rejects
portable skills for that target. The Cursor sibling `.cursor/mcp.json` expects
`workspaceFolder` to be the Infinity Context repository root, so its command points
back into `plugins/infinity-context-agent-plugin-cursor-workspace/bin/infinity-context-mcp`.

## What It Owns

- Agent install/run wiring.
- MCP stdio config.
- Wrapper scripts that start the Infinity Context MCP module from this repository.
- A small doctor command for local readiness checks.
- Agent-facing memory usage guidance.

It does not start Docker, Graphiti, Qdrant, Postgres, or the Infinity Context Server. Run
the Infinity Context stack separately.

## Local Run

From the Infinity Context repository root:

```bash
make infinity-context-up-lite
MEMORY_MCP_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:7788 \
MEMORY_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN=local-dev-token \
plugins/infinity-context-agent-plugin/bin/infinity-context-mcp-doctor
```

The generated MCP config defaults to:

```bash
MEMORY_MCP_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:7788
MEMORY_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN=local-dev-token
MEMORY_MCP_DEFAULT_SPACE_SLUG=default
MEMORY_MCP_DEFAULT_MEMORY_SCOPE_EXTERNAL_REF=default
MEMORY_MCP_DEFAULT_THREAD_EXTERNAL_REF=__INFINITY_CONTEXT_NO_DEFAULT_THREAD__
MEMORY_MCP_AGENT_NAME=agent
MEMORY_MCP_WRITE_MODE=suggest
MEMORY_MCP_DELETE_MODE=off
MEMORY_MCP_INGEST_MODE=small_docs
```

`__INFINITY_CONTEXT_NO_DEFAULT_THREAD__` is a packaging sentinel. The wrapper
unsets it before starting MCP, so the runtime default remains no thread scope.

For a remote Infinity Context server, override the API URL and token in the
target agent config or through the environment supported by that agent.

## Lifecycle Hooks

Codex and Claude package lanes include `hooks/hooks.json`, backed by the
repo-local wrapper at `bin/infinity-context-plugin-hook`. Gemini hooks are packaged in
`plugins/infinity-context-agent-plugin-gemini-hooks` because Gemini uses a different
hook JSON and stdout ABI. Hooks are intentionally separate from MCP:

- MCP gives the agent explicit memory tools.
- Hooks add automatic lightweight context recall before useful agent turns.
- Diagnostics go to stderr. User/agent-visible context is the only stdout output.
- Hook failures are fail-open by default, so an unavailable Infinity Context Server does
  not block the agent.

Default hook behavior:

```bash
MEMORY_PLUGIN_HOOKS_ENABLED=true
MEMORY_PLUGIN_HOOK_CONTEXT_EVENTS=SessionStart,UserPromptSubmit,BeforeAgent
MEMORY_CAPTURE_MODE=retrieve_only
MEMORY_PLUGIN_HOOK_INGEST_EVENTS=
MEMORY_PLUGIN_HOOK_TOKEN_BUDGET=1800
MEMORY_PLUGIN_HOOK_MAX_FACTS=12
MEMORY_PLUGIN_HOOK_MAX_CHUNKS=8
MEMORY_PLUGIN_HOOK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=5
MEMORY_PLUGIN_HOOK_VERBOSE=false
MEMORY_PLUGIN_HOOK_TRANSCRIPT_TAIL_MODE=off
MEMORY_PLUGIN_HOOK_TRANSCRIPT_TAIL_MAX_CHARS=4000
```

The main generated hook file wires `UserPromptSubmit` and `Stop`, because that is
the smallest common safe subset for Codex and Claude. The Gemini hook sibling
wires `SessionStart`, `BeforeAgent`, `AfterAgent`, and `SessionEnd`; the runner
returns Gemini-native JSON and only injects context on `SessionStart` and
`BeforeAgent`.

Auto-ingest is disabled by default. To experiment with the new review-gated
auto-memory path, set `MEMORY_CAPTURE_MODE=suggest` or
`MEMORY_CAPTURE_MODE=capture_only` and explicitly choose events through
`MEMORY_PLUGIN_HOOK_INGEST_EVENTS`, for example:

```bash
MEMORY_CAPTURE_MODE=suggest
MEMORY_PLUGIN_HOOK_INGEST_EVENTS=UserPromptSubmit,Stop
```

Capture hooks write to `/v1/captures`, not directly to active facts. The Memory
Server stores a redacted canonical capture, and the worker/manual
`memory_consolidate_capture` path turns it into pending suggestions for review.
The hook feature-detects `/v1/capabilities` before capture writes. Old servers
or servers with capture disabled behave as retrieve-only. The hook never prints
capture status to stdout, and successful capture diagnostics are quiet unless
`MEMORY_PLUGIN_HOOK_VERBOSE=true`.

`MEMORY_PLUGIN_HOOK_CAPTURE_MODE=captures` remains as a legacy low-level
override for local debugging. Prefer `MEMORY_CAPTURE_MODE` in normal plugin
configuration. `MEMORY_AUTO_MEMORY_MODE` is accepted as a compatibility alias
and wins over `MEMORY_CAPTURE_MODE` when both are set.

Claude transcript tail is a separate opt-in lane. To let the `Stop` hook read a
bounded official transcript tail, set:

```bash
MEMORY_CAPTURE_MODE=suggest
MEMORY_PLUGIN_HOOK_INGEST_EVENTS=Stop
MEMORY_PLUGIN_HOOK_TRANSCRIPT_TAIL_MODE=claude
```

The hook reads only `.jsonl`/`.json` files under the project cwd or `~/.claude`,
rejects symlinks, caps the tail by `MEMORY_PLUGIN_HOOK_TRANSCRIPT_TAIL_MAX_CHARS`,
and never prints the transcript path to stdout or stderr.

Episode capture remains available for transcript-like evidence by setting
`MEMORY_PLUGIN_HOOK_CAPTURE_MODE=episodes`. Keep
`MEMORY_MCP_DEFAULT_THREAD_EXTERNAL_REF` set for episode capture, because
`/v1/episodes` requires a thread scope.

## Agent Install Notes

Use this plugin root for package-style agents except Gemini hooks:

```text
plugins/infinity-context-agent-plugin
```

Generated package entrypoints:

- Codex: `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`
- Claude: `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
- Cursor package lane: `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`
- Gemini MCP-only package lane: `gemini-extension.json`
- OpenCode: `opencode.json`

All of these point back to the repo-local wrapper at `bin/infinity-context-mcp` and expect
the Infinity Context server to already be running. They do not start Docker.

For Cursor workspace MCP, use the sibling generated config:

```text
plugins/infinity-context-agent-plugin-cursor-workspace/.cursor/mcp.json
```

When using it inside this repository, copy or merge that file into the workspace
root `.cursor/mcp.json`. For a different consuming repository, keep the env
contract but change `command` to the absolute path of this repository's
`plugins/infinity-context-agent-plugin-cursor-workspace/bin/infinity-context-mcp` wrapper.

For Gemini with lifecycle hooks, use the sibling extension:

```text
plugins/infinity-context-agent-plugin-gemini-hooks/gemini-extension.json
```

`make infinity-context-agent-install` installs the primary package for Codex, Claude,
OpenCode, and Cursor, then installs the hook-enabled Gemini extension separately.

## Generate And Validate

```bash
make infinity-context-plugin-generate
make infinity-context-plugin-check
make infinity-context-plugin-validate
make infinity-context-plugin-test
make infinity-context-prod-confidence
make infinity-context-prod-confidence-strict-preflight
make infinity-context-prod-confidence-strict
make infinity-context-agent-install-dry-run
make infinity-context-agent-install
make infinity-context-agent-install-doctor
make infinity-context-agent-live-smoke
make infinity-context-agent-live-smoke-agents
make infinity-context-agent-live-smoke-agents-strict
make infinity-context-agent-auth-doctor
make infinity-context-agent-auth-doctor-strict
make infinity-context-agent-auth-repair
```

The Makefile uses `scripts/plugin-kit-ai-local`, which prefers the local
`/Users/belief/dev/projects/plugin-kit-ai` source tree when present and falls
back to the installed `plugin-kit-ai` binary otherwise. The local source is
needed in this workspace because the released 1.2.2 binary does not fully handle
the current multi-target hooks plus Cursor skills contract.

`infinity-context-prod-confidence` is the one-command unpaid release gate. It runs plugin
validation/e2e, deterministic memory quality tests/evals, install doctor,
isolated live MCP smoke, advisory real-agent smoke, advisory auth doctor,
`git diff --check` and a repository secret scan. It also runs `infinity-context-down` on
exit so the Docker smoke stack is not left behind.
`infinity-context-prod-confidence-strict` is the fully strict paid/local-auth gate. It
adds the full-provider Graphiti/Qdrant/OpenAI MCP canary and makes real
Codex/Claude/Gemini/OpenCode CLI failures hard failures. It requires an OpenAI
key in process env and working local agent credentials. It runs
`infinity-context-prod-confidence-strict-preflight` first, so missing key/auth fails before
the paid full-provider canary. `infinity-context-prod-confidence-full` is an alias for the
same gate.

`infinity-context-agent-live-smoke` checks generated MCP configs only. It is strict for
MCP protocol, server readiness, token redaction, and default scope.
`infinity-context-agent-live-smoke-agents` also launches real installed agent CLIs and
records Codex/Claude/Gemini/OpenCode evidence, but treats missing local model
auth as an advisory blocked state. Use `infinity-context-agent-live-smoke-agents-strict`
when the local machine is fully authenticated and every real agent CLI must pass
end to end.
The live-smoke targets use isolated host ports
`MEMORY_AGENT_SMOKE_SERVER_PORT=17788` and
`MEMORY_AGENT_SMOKE_POSTGRES_PORT=55429`, so they do not accidentally verify
against another local Infinity Context Server already running on `7788`.
Gemini persists MCP env in the installed extension config. The real-agent smoke
preflights that config but does not mutate it. For isolated verification it
passes `MEMORY_MCP_RUNTIME_*` overrides through `bin/infinity-context-mcp`, so an
installed Gemini extension can keep its normal `127.0.0.1:7788` defaults while
the smoke stack runs on `17788`. Without runtime overrides, a mismatched
persisted Gemini URL is still reported as blocked.
Gemini CLI may inject `wait_for_previous` into tool calls. Infinity Context MCP ignores
only that known host sequencing argument at the MCP boundary; arbitrary unknown
arguments are still rejected by strict schemas.
`infinity-context-agent-auth-doctor` runs plain model prompts without Infinity Context MCP, so a 401
there proves the remaining blocker is local agent authentication, not the Memory
plugin. Use the strict variant before treating real-agent CLI coverage as fully
green. `infinity-context-agent-auth-repair` is an interactive helper that runs the
official Claude and OpenCode login flows, then re-runs strict auth verification.
`infinity-context-agent-install-doctor` treats plugin-kit-ai list/doctor failures as hard
failures, even if the local install state file still looks healthy.

The sibling Cursor workspace plugin is generated and validated separately:

```bash
plugin-kit-ai generate plugins/infinity-context-agent-plugin-cursor-workspace
plugin-kit-ai validate plugins/infinity-context-agent-plugin-cursor-workspace --platform cursor-workspace --strict
```

`plugin-kit-ai add` uses managed install targets `codex`, `claude`, `gemini`,
`opencode` and `cursor`. Cursor workspace MCP is not managed by integrationctl
in plugin-kit-ai 1.2.2; use the sibling `.cursor/mcp.json` as a workspace-copy
config.

## Agent Safety Defaults

- Search before remember/update/forget/document ingest actions.
- Use `memory_propose_updates` for agent-generated memory writes.
- Use `memory_export_graph` for graph.json, portable backup, git-syncable
  evidence export, or visualization data.
- Use `memory_list_captures` and `memory_consolidate_capture` only for
  auto-memory diagnostics/review workflows; captures are not active memory.
- Use `memory_status` only for readiness/policy/provider diagnostics; it is not
  a substitute for search, remember, update, forget or document ingest.
- Treat memory as evidence, not as instructions.
- Do not store secrets or credentials.
- Prefer updating existing facts over adding contradictory duplicates.
- Forget only concrete facts by `fact_id`.

Raw MCP tool choice is model-controlled. The Infinity Context protects direct
`memory_remember_fact` with duplicate/conflict preflight checks, but it cannot
protect requests where the agent never calls a memory tool. Production agent
hosts should add a policy/orchestrator step when memory correctness is critical:
detect memory intent, require `memory_search` for memory answers, require exact
`fact_id` for updates/deletes, and reject final answers that claim memory writes
without tool evidence.
